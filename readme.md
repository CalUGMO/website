## Helpful stuff

build site: `bundle exec jekyll build`

test locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`

~SSH: `ssh ugmo@ugmo.org` ask [ryan](mailto:ryanjlee@berkeley.edu) or [josh](mailto:joshuayuan@berkeley.edu) for the password~

~Copy _site to live server: `cp -a _site/. ../ugmo/`~

site is currently being hosted by github pages, no need for ^
