<h2 class="name">Tommy Lin | <em>#25</em></span></h2>
<p class="data">4th year from Sammamish, WA, studying Molecular Biology & Biochemistry</p>
<p class="bio">Sir Thomas Lin III, more commonly known as “Tommy”, has the best dimples on the team, the biggest quads on the team, and the biggest heart on the team. When he's not hiding from girls, Tommy can be spotted at every practice/tournament/film sesh bringing his boys up with him on his journey to glory. In other words, Tommy is Drake, and you can catch him running through the six with his throws every time he cleats up.</p>
