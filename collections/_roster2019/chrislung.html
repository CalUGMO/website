<h2 class="name">Chris Lung | <em>#22</em></span></h2>
<p class="data">3rd year from Sherman Oaks, CA, studying Materials Science and Engineering</p>
<p class="bio">Chris has been serving up the sauce with his throws all season, so much so that he is the first frisbee player to have been awarded the Michelin Star. Chef Chris never struggles to break his marks around with a savory selection of lefty backhands, inverts, and low releases. That’s not all, Chef Chris also specializes in desserts; with sweet skies downfield, and a presence on deep defense that helps Coach Dan sleep at night. In the words of Chris himself, “if I don’t have to move, it’s over.”</p>
