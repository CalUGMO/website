<h2 class="name">Munis Thahir | <em>#12</em></span></h2>
<p class="data">2nd year from Chantilly, VA, studying Nuclear Engineering</p>
<p class="bio">Hatched in the nearby Potomac river, just like our first president, Guppy strives to make the Mid-Atlantic feel like a validated part of America. Three years ago, after finally breaking through the friend zone, eleven year old Guppy swam upstream. Once he reached California, he became hooked on the prospect of huge skies and layout Ds. You might recognize him from his Oscar winning performance as Giles in The Shape of Water. He may never bowl a strike, but heâ€™ll probably spare you the fish puns.</p>
