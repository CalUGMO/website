<h2 class="name">Glenn Wysen | <em>#11</em></span></h2>
<p class="data">2nd year from Seattle, WA, studying Astro</p>
<p class="bio">It’s too bad this kid doesn’t have three N’s in his name because he’s always gunnin’ on the field! Born and raised by giants, it is no surprise that Glenn loves big hucks and huge skies. When he isn’t exposing fools on the field, he can be found buying four figure drones and selling them for 50 cent profits or eating that 0 out of 10/wasting away/death by paperclip feeling of a Dick’s Burg….. errrrrrrrrrr enjoying nerd life in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>
