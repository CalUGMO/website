<h2 class="name">Jace Bruner | <em>#15</em></span></h2>
<p class="data">2nd year from San Anselmo, CA, studying Undeclared Engineering</p>
<p class="bio">Jace is really fast. Like, really really fast. At one point in time, he heard that a rocket ship travels at approximately 7 miles a second, to which he responded, “that’s it?”. When he’s not racing SpaceX rockets for fun, you can catch Jace in the gym 8 times a week. That’s one lift for each day, and one more to stunt on anyone who dares to guard him.</p>
