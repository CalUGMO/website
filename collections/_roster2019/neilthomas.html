<p class="data">Graduate student from Santa Monica, CA, studying Computer Science PhD</p>
<p class="bio">Very few people know that Neil has been alive since the 16th century and was a well known playwright. He’s written classics such as “Romeo and Juliet”, “Hamlet”, and “The Taming of the Shrew.” Unfortunately, he was bitten by a vampire in his mid 20s and has been cursed with longevity. Fortunately, he has decided to join UGMO this season and is using his superhuman strength to terrorize opposing teams.</p>
