<h2 class="name">Joshua Yuan | <em>#14</em></span></h2>
<p class="data">4th year from San Jose, CA, studying Computer Science</p>
<p class="bio">Standing at 7 feet and 11 inches, Joshua “Lil J” Yuan might just be the shortest monkey in the jungle, but he more than makes it up for it with his “fade away” sky. With this signature finishing move, Lil J elevates so high that the universe adjusts its gravitational pull on Joshua, making it seem like he’s falling. In reality, Lil J catches the disc, eats a 5-course meal on the Moon (our boy has a massive appetite), and then returns to Earth to grace us with - you know it- his classic smile.</p>
