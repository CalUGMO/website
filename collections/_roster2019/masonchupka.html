<p class="data">3rd year from Davis, CA, studying </p>
<p class="bio">Coming from the swamps of Middle California, Mason has the reputation of a flaccid stalk of celery: hot out the oven. When he’s not biting squirrel heads off for their precious nectar you can find him greasing his vocabulary with a Webster’s Dictionary. His frisbee alias, Jeb Goldenfoot, can be seen lighting up any defense with his quick cuts, or shutting down the mark his wax-on-wax-off hand technique.</p>
