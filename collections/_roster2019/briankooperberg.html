<h2 class="name">Brian Kooperberg | <em>#77</em></span></h2>
<p class="data">4th year from Seattle, WA, studying Computer Science</p>
<p class="bio">Koop is the flawless creation of two biostatistical genius geneticists. From a young age, Koop was trained in the vast arts of sports trivia, where his knowledge of anything going on in the sports world led to him wooing many girls across the frisbee universe. You might think that Koop doesn’t say much, and you’d be right! But, you might not have guessed that he’s protecting you from his unyielding seductive voice as he croons Josh Turner’s “Your Man”.</p>
