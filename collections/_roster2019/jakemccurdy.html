<h2 class="name">Jake McCurdy  | <em>#18</em></span></h2>
<p class="data">2nd year from South Pasadena, CA, studying Molecular Environmental Biology</p>
<p class="bio">Jake has spent the entire year laying the groundwork for UGMO’s success this year, with lots of behind the scenes logistics work and being one of the team’s crowdfunding leaders on his first year with the team. With fakes that will send you to the fourth-dimension, sideline talk that rivals the armed forces, not to mention filmmaking skills that rival Steven Spielberg, Jake is the complete package of a team player.</p>
