<h2 class="name">Alex Pan | <em>#19</em></span></h2>
<p class="data">4th year from Novi, MI, studying Computer Science</p>
<p class="bio">The eldest of three, Alex Pan shined from a young age as a track star. He narrowly lost to B. Rabbit in the Michigan State Middle School Track Championship, and abruptly quit track to focus on Ultimate Frisbee. His brother Peter plays for Michigan MagnUM and his sister Sauce plays for Dartmouth Princess Layout. What an impressive family! #smallhandsbigheart</p>
