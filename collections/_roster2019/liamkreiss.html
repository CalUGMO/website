<p class="bio">Tuna is the team sweetheart, and you would never doubt that fact when you look at UGMO’s favorite camp counselor/safety officer/lifeguard/fish bro. He is always smiling, and keeps us smiling and healthy throughout the season. Whether he’s taping your ankle, bandaging your wound, brushing your teeth, or making you a romantic dinner, Tuna puts it all on the line to take care of you.</p>
