<h2 class="name">Trevor Aquino | <em>#23</em></span></h2>
<p class="data">2nd year from San Jose, CA, studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</p>
<p class="bio">In just his first year of UGMO, Dingo has put in mad work to show up some of the nation’s best frisbee players. With his scrappiness on D, Trevor generates tons of blocks and causes tons of poor throws. None of that matters though, the real reason he’s on the team is his dance moves. He’s generated so many wins just by unnerving opponents with his sideline samba, he’s become a national sensation as the underdog candidate for Dancing with the Stars. He also gets the most girls on the team, that matters too I guess.</p>
