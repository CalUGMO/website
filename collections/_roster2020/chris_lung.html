info1: If you’ve ever said “WOW” or “HOLY MOLY” while watching UGMO, you were probably talking about Chris Lung. Hammers, Scoobers, Full-Field Hucks, or  Left-Handed anything are just a few of the throws in Chris Lung’s arsenal. If you’re marking him this year, good luck. We can’t wait to see what Chris (and his hair) will do in his senior season!
