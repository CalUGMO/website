It hopes to develop future Ultimate stars who can go onto play for our A Team, UGMO, as well as provide a place for people that want to play some club Ultimate and develop their skills.</p>
      <p>Thugmo is the current Southwest Developmental College Men’s reigning champ and looks to continue the tradition. Thugmo was ranked 184(including all the A teams) in the Nation last year and is looking to break into the top 150 this season with the help of captains: Logan Ritter, Ayush Sharma, Kevin Gibson Weinberger</p>
