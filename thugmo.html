      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGrEO_7L8bU">Thugmo</a> is the Men’s Ultimate B Team for the University of California, Berkeley. It hopes to develop future Ultimate stars who can go onto play for our A Team, UGMO, as well as provide a place for people that want to play some club Ultimate and develop their skills.</p>
      <p>Thugmo is the current Southwest Developmental College Men’s reigning champ and looks to continue the tradition. Thugmo was ranked 226th (including all the A teams) in the Nation last year and is looking to break into the top 150 this season with the help of captains: David E. Campos, Logan E. Ritter, and John S. Diven.</p>
