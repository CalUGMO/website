info1: Open your eyes and your hearts for one of our two new captains this season, sophomore Max Williams! Despite only playing frisbee for the first time last year, Max was a force on our D-line, where his long arms and quick feet made him one of the toughest marks in the Southwest. And when they got the turn...let me tell you, he got BIG. Don’t believe me? Check out our Nationals highlight reel. You’ll know it when you see it.
