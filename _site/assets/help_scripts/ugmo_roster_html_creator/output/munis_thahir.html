<h2 class="name">Munis (Guppy) Thahir | <em>#12</em></span></h2>
<p class="data">Junior from Chantilly, VA, studying Nuclear Engineeting and minoring in EECS</p>
<p class="bio">After being elected Captain for the 2018/2019 season, Guppy stepped up in a big way both on and off the field. He’s a lock every tournament to lose his voice delivering his famous pregame speeches AND to sky your biggest dude. Catch him in the end zone this year still trying to figure out how to kickspike. You’ll get it one day Gup!</p>
