<h2 class="name">Jace Bruner | <em>#15</em></span></h2>
<p class="data">Junior studying EECS and minoring in Environmental Econ and Public Policy from San Anselmo, CA</p>
<p class="bio">With his gravity-defying layouts, light-speed cuts and starry smile, it’s the one and only “Space” Jace Bruner! When he wasn’t making huge plays for UGMO last season, he was always down to entertain the team with his slick dance moves, cute monkey antics or by beating Ryan in Smash. We can’t wait to see what Jace does as captain this year because whatever it is, it’ll be big!</p>
