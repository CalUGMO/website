<p class="bio">The eldest of three, Alex Pan shined from a young age as a track star. He narrowly lost to B. Rabbit in the Michigan State Middle School Track Championship, and abruptly quit track to focus on Ultimate Frisbee. His brother Peter plays for Michigan MagnUM and his sister Sauce plays for Dartmouth Princess Layout. What an impressive family! #smallhandsbigheart</p>

Passionate about child education and bettering the world through smiles, Ashwin is the most eligible bachelor on the team, and if you want to learn more about his dance moves or work at Google, start a Venmo conversation with him @Ashwin-Vaidyanathan!.</p>

<p class="data">4th year from Seattle, WA, studying Computer Science</p>
<p class="bio">Koop is the flawless creation of two biostatistical genius geneticists. From a young age, Koop was trained in the vast arts of sports trivia, where his knowledge of anything going on in the sports world led to him wooing many girls across the frisbee universe. You might think that Koop doesn’t say much, and you’d be right! But, you might not have guessed that he’s protecting you from his unyielding seductive voice as he croons Josh Turner’s “Your Man”.</p>

<p class="data">3rd year from Sherman Oaks, CA, studying Materials Science and Engineering</p>
<p class="bio">Chris has been serving up the sauce with his throws all season, so much so that he is the first frisbee player to have been awarded the Michelin Star. Chef Chris never struggles to break his marks around with a savory selection of lefty backhands, inverts, and low releases. That’s not all, Chef Chris also specializes in desserts; with sweet skies downfield, and a presence on deep defense that helps Coach Dan sleep at night. In the words of Chris himself, “if I don’t have to move, it’s over.”</p>

Born and raised by giants, it is no surprise that Glenn loves big hucks and huge skies. When he isn’t exposing fools on the field, he can be found buying four figure drones and selling them for 50 cent profits or eating that 0 out of 10/wasting away/death by paperclip feeling of a Dick’s Burg….. errrrrrrrrrr enjoying nerd life in Albuquerque, New Mexico.</p>

<p class="data">2nd year from San Anselmo, CA, studying Undeclared Engineering</p>
<p class="bio">Jace is really fast. Like, really really fast. At one point in time, he heard that a rocket ship travels at approximately 7 miles a second, to which he responded, “that’s it?”. When he’s not racing SpaceX rockets for fun, you can catch Jace in the gym 8 times a week. That’s one lift for each day, and one more to stunt on anyone who dares to guard him.</p>

<p class="data">2nd year from South Pasadena, CA, studying Molecular Environmental Biology</p>
<p class="bio">Jake has spent the entire year laying the groundwork for UGMO’s success this year, with lots of behind the scenes logistics work and being one of the team’s crowdfunding leaders on his first year with the team. With fakes that will send you to the fourth-dimension, sideline talk that rivals the armed forces, not to mention filmmaking skills that rival Steven Spielberg, Jake is the complete package of a team player.</p>

<p class="bio">Standing at 7 feet and 11 inches, Joshua “Lil J” Yuan might just be the shortest monkey in the jungle, but he more than makes it up for it with his “fade away” sky. With this signature finishing move, Lil J elevates so high that the universe adjusts its gravitational pull on Joshua, making it seem like he’s falling. In reality, Lil J catches the disc, eats a 5-course meal on the Moon (our boy has a massive appetite), and then returns to Earth to grace us with - you know it- his classic smile.</p>

<p class="bio">Tuna is the team sweetheart, and you would never doubt that fact when you look at UGMO’s favorite camp counselor/safety officer/lifeguard/fish bro. He is always smiling, and keeps us smiling and healthy throughout the season. Whether he’s taping your ankle, bandaging your wound, brushing your teeth, or making you a romantic dinner, Tuna puts it all on the line to take care of you.</p>

<p class="bio">Coming from the swamps of Middle California, Mason has the reputation of a flaccid stalk of celery: hot out the oven. When he’s not biting squirrel heads off for their precious nectar you can find him greasing his vocabulary with a Webster’s Dictionary. His frisbee alias, Jeb Goldenfoot, can be seen lighting up any defense with his quick cuts, or shutting down the mark his wax-on-wax-off hand technique.</p>

<p class="data">2nd year from Chantilly, VA, studying Nuclear Engineering</p>
<p class="bio">Hatched in the nearby Potomac river, just like our first president, Guppy strives to make the Mid-Atlantic feel like a validated part of America. Three years ago, after finally breaking through the friend zone, eleven year old Guppy swam upstream. Once he reached California, he became hooked on the prospect of huge skies and layout Ds. You might recognize him from his Oscar winning performance as Giles in The Shape of Water. He may never bowl a strike, but he’ll probably spare you the fish puns.</p>

He’s written classics such as “Romeo and Juliet”, “Hamlet”, and “The Taming of the Shrew.” Unfortunately, he was bitten by a vampire in his mid 20s and has been cursed with longevity. Fortunately, he has decided to join UGMO this season and is using his superhuman strength to terrorize opposing teams.</p>

<p class="bio">Sir Thomas Lin III, more commonly known as “Tommy”, has the best dimples on the team, the biggest quads on the team, and the biggest heart on the team. When he's not hiding from girls, Tommy can be spotted at every practice/tournament/film sesh bringing his boys up with him on his journey to glory. In other words, Tommy is Drake, and you can catch him running through the six with his throws every time he cleats up.</p>

With his scrappiness on D, Trevor generates tons of blocks and causes tons of poor throws. None of that matters though, the real reason he’s on the team is his dance moves. He’s generated so many wins just by unnerving opponents with his sideline samba, he’s become a national sensation as the underdog candidate for Dancing with the Stars. He also gets the most girls on the team, that matters too I guess.</p>
